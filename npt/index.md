# Northville-Placid Trail Through Hiking Trip Plan

## Itinerary

I will be hiking north-bound on the NPT starting at approximately 7:30am, June 1st, until 11:15am, June 10th. The trail is approximately 138 miles from Northville, NY to Lake Placid, NY. A map of the trail can be found [here](http://www.nptrail.org/current-trail-conditions/interactive-trail-map/).

The daily mileage is approximate, but in order to arrive at my destination on June 10th I will need to average 15 miles a day. However my bus from Lake Placid to Albany leaves at 11:15am from the Olympic Bus Depot in Lake Placid on 6/10, so I will be trying to finish the day on 6/9 at the last feasible camp site on the NPT before Lake Placid, to try to keep my mileage on the final day as light as possible to make arriving on time easier, thus a daily pace of 16-17 miles on average will be likely. The spacing of camp sites along the trail being what it is, this will likely differ day to day from as few as 12 miles, to as many as 20 (hopefully on latter days when my pack is lighter from food consumption).

I will be signing in at every trail register along the NPT, and the clothing section below contains pictures of the bottoms of my hiking boots if they are needed to assist in locating me if I am out of contact longer than expected.

As much as possible I will be overnighting in marked camping sites and near lean-tos, although since dispersed camping is allowed along most of the trail it is possible I might instead camp off-trail at a site meeting all of the requirements for dispersed camping (typically >150 from trail and any water sources). Additionally I will be hanging my food an all other scented items in a bright blue dry sack (see gear section) at least 150 feet from camp, using the two-rope hanging method to help mitigate issues with critters and potentially bears as I get nearer the Lake Placid area. I will not be carrying a bear canister due to the added weight and bulk and since it is not required outside of the Eastern High Peaks region.

## Food

The following is a full accounting of the food I will be carying on the trail. I have budgetted approximately 3k calories a day. This will leave me running a daily calorie deficit, and I anticipate by the end of the trail I will have burned 3-5 pounds of body fat. I am primarily packing fat-heavy foods, plus some foods with carbs. I am lacking in protein overall, though I have some modest sources in nuts and oats that should allow me to get over the minimum ammount required to perform.

I am not planning to conduct any resupply at towns along the trail, so this accounts for all of my food:

The total Calorie count for my food is 29,470, and the weight is 5.971Kg (13.16lbs).

Additionally I am bringing a bottle of electrolyte drops that I will be adding to some of my water each day to supplement salt, potassium, and several other electrolytes which I will be depleting during the hike. I will be carrying two 1-liter smart water bottles and a sawyer mini filter along with two dirty water bags and the filter flushing plunger, these can be seen in the gear section.

## Contact Info

I should be able to get into contact by the end of the day on 6/10 at the latest, as I am meeting the property manager at my new apartement at approximately 5:30pm on June 10th. If my phone is dead and I am unable to recharge it before getting into my new apartment, I will not be in contact until around 6pm EST 6/10.

Should I fail to get in contact by the 11th or so, please contact the NYS DEC Search and Rescue team at (518-408-5850) with the necessary information to begin search and rescure operations. Providing them the URL to this site would likely be a good idea.
