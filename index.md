### About Me

I am a computer science PhD candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY. I develop software for HPC machi es and applications. My thesis work has been concerning the development of tools and 
libraries for the efficient implementation and execution of multi-scale numerical simulations on HPC architectures.

I'm also an avid hiker and a leader in the RPI Graduate Outdoor Recreation Program. I am a 46r and am working on becoming a winter 46r as well.

### Research

My thesis work is focused on the development of the Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation Infrastructure (AMSI), a set of libraries intended to assist in the development and execution of numerically multi-scale and multi-model simulations, specifically on HPC machines targeting in particular the IBM BluegGene/Q architecture, though intended for use on any HPC platform. 

Additionally I have conducted work to develop multi-scale mechanics simulations including a soft biological tissue simulation using the AMSI libraries to support development and execution.

### Code 

[LAS](https://github.com/tobinw/las) Is a zero-overhead API for operating on linear algebraic systems, taking advantage of the C++ Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) and aggressive inlining to optimize the API functions away at compile-time.
