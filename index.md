### About Me

I am a computer science PhD candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY. I develop software for HPC machines and applications. My thesis work has been concerning the development of tools and libraries for the efficient implementation and execution of multi-scale numerical simulations on HPC architectures.

I'm also an avid hiker and a 46r (#10768) and I'm working on becoming a winter 46r as well. I'm also a leader in the RPI Graduate Outdoor Recreation Program (GORP) and design and lead both events for the general graduate student body and training events for GORP leaders-in-training.

### Research

My thesis and primary work has been the Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation Infrastructure (AMSI), a set of libraries to assist in the development and execution of numerically multi-scale simulations, specifically on HPC machines but targeting in particular the IBM BluegGene/Q architecture. Most performance runs involving AMSI-supported code have been conducted on the AMOS BlueGene/Q machine managed by the [CCI](http://cci.rpi.edu/).

Additionally I have conducted work to develop numerical HPC simulations and tools including a multi-scale soft biological tissue simulation using the AMSI libraries, the Simmetrix backend for the SCOREC/core tools, and am currently assisting in the development of several fusion codebases.

### Code 

[LAS](https://github.com/tobinw/las) Is a zero-overhead API for operating on linear algebraic systems, taking advantage of the C++ Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) and aggressive inlining to optimize the API functions away at compile-time.
