### About Me

I do massively parallel numerical computing research, where I specialize in work on developing multi-scale simulations and software to support the implementation and execution of said simulations.

Also I go outside sometimes and hike things, or bike things, or canoe things, or go on backpacking trips and hike things for a long time.
