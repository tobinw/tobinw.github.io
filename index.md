"A CPU is literally a rock we tricked into thinking."

### About Me

I do massively parallel numerical computing research, where I specialize in work on developing multi-scale simulations and software to support the implementation and execution of said simulations.

Also I go outside sometimes and hike things, or bike things, or canoe things, or go on backpacking trips and hike things for a long time.

### Research

My thesis work is focused on the development of the Adaptive Multi-model Simulation Infrastructure (AMSI), a set of libraries intended to assist in the development and execution of numerically multi-scale and multi-model simulations, specifically on HPC machines targeting in particular the IBM BluegGene/Q architechture, though intended for use on any HPC platform. 

Additionally I have conducted work to develop a multi-scale mechanics simulation of soft biological tissues using the AMSI libraries to support development and execution of the simulation.
